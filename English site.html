    <p class="aboutme">Hi, I’m a badminton enthusiast from India. In this blog, I’ll share my thoughts and opinions on these two passions of mine. <br><br>

        Badminton is a sport that I’ve been playing since I was a kid. I love the thrill of smashing the shuttlecock, the agility <br>
        and stamina required to move around the court, and the camaraderie and friendship that I’ve developed with my fellow players. <br><br>

        I love video games. They are a great way for me to have fun. My favourite is Fortnite. Fortnite is a game where you have to be <br>
        the last one standing against 99 other players. I enjoy the game because when you win you feel a sense of victory and that is why <br>
        it is my favourite game. <br><br>

        I can speak English, Konkani, and Hindi fluently. These are the languages that I use to communicate with my family, friends, and <br>
        colleagues. I really love learning phrases in different languages since I feel more diverse and multi- cultural and it feels better <br>
        than using something like Google Translate. <br><br>

        My favourite book is Wonder. Wonder is a novel by R.J. Palacio that tells the story of August Pullman, a ten-year-old boy who was <br>
        born with a facial problems that have made him the subject to bullies. The book shows how he learnt to adapt in a way that is both <br>
        heartwarming but a bit sad. When August begins attending school for the first time, where he faces many challenges and learns to <br>
        overcome them with the help of his friends and family. <br><br>

        My childhood crush is Shane Warne because he was one of the best bowlers back in the day until he passed away last year. He was not <br>
        exactly my crush but in my mind he was a legend to modern day cricket. <br>

            <h7><b>Blue Print of original Romeo and Juliet:</b></h7> <br>
            <i>Theme(Akshay):</i><br>
            The play Romeo and Juliet shows different themes. The most important theme is love, which is the major focus of the play. It focuses on <br>
            the love between Romeo and Juliet. Love in this play is the thing that causes the death of both Romeo and Juliet and causes people like <br>
            Tybalt and Mercutio to also die showing that this value is a key theme in the play. <br><br>

            Another major theme is violence. Romeo fights for Juliet and creates lots of hate between him and Tybalt. The play portrays how violence <br>
            is a major part of love and that you have to make sacrifices. Love and violence go hand in hand at various times throughout the play. <br><br>

            In conclusion, the themes include the power of love, honour, and violence seen in the city of Verona. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="RomeoJulietAdaptation">
            <h7><b>Romeo and Juliet Adaptations:</b></h7> <br><br>
            The movie has a romantic theme and is set in Verona, Italy, which is the same setting as Shakespeare's original play.  “You need only the <br>
            courage to follow your heart. I don’t know what a love like Juliet’s feels like: love to leave loved ones for, love to cross oceans for, <br>
            but I’d like to believe if I ever were to feel it, that I’d have the courage to seize it. And Claire, if you didn’t, I hope one day that <br>
            you will. All my love, Juliet.” The characters in the movie are different from those in the play, but they share similar traits such as the <br>
            main character is a bit more independent woman just like the original. The new audience for the movie is people who enjoy romantic dramas, <br>
            while the original audience for Shakespeare's play was people who enjoyed tragic plays. This is an implicit adaptation of the original adaptations. <br>
            The setting of the movie is modern-day Verona, while the setting of Shakespeare's play was 16th century Verona. In terms of genre, letters to Juliet <br>
            is a romantic drama film, while "Romeo and Juliet" is a tragic play. The two scripts share similar themes such as love, fate, and tragedy. However, <br>
            they differ in terms of plot and character development. In summary, "Letters to Juliet" is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet" <br>
            with different characters and plot but similar themes. <br> <br><br><br>

        <p class="CompareContrastRosaline">
            <h7><b>Compare and Contrast of Rosaline:</b></h7> <br><br>
                Some of the similarities between the two works is that both are love stories that involve romance and trickery. In the original it focuses mostly <br>
                on the love of both of them and their strong relationship that even leads to death . In this adaptation it is a  bit different, as instead this focuses <br>
                on Rosalines perspective in the new found love between Romeo and Juliet. They both also have the  exact same setting which is Verona, Italy. <br><br>

                Some of the differences between them is that the perspective is mostly on Rosaline and how she feels betrayed also another major difference is the <br>
                genre from a play to a movie and in this movie it is not only more faced paced but includes things like music, and vfx to make it more interesting.  <br>
                Another small difference is the inclusion of more characters as to show Rosalines perspective.  This shows that this is an implicit adaptation with lots <br>
                of changes from the original. <br><br>

                Hulu made this movie more focused on Rosaline showing that was also a important character in the play adding humour whereas the original only focused on <br>
                the Montagues and Capulets. "Its your boyfriends audience, ouch!", O Tybalt, "Tybalt, the best friend I had! ". This line from Rosaline shows modern comedy <br>
                whereas the second line shows the sarcastic jokes that were funny during Shakespeare time which shows the difference of comedy between the two showing why this <br>
                would attract modern audiences. The addition of the perspective being shifted to Rosaline and adding humour may bring in a new audiences who do not like the traditional <br>
                idea of love, honor and violence as it is more shifted to humour and comedy. This may also bring in people who are scared of death and violence as this is a humour and comedy <br>
                film, violence will not really appear within the film. All these major changes will shift the idea of Romeo and Juliet to a more modern audience. <br><br>

                In conclusion, this is a different adaptation to the original having a creative take on the original making it into Rosalines perspective and not Romeo or Juliets <br>
                perspective with lots of major differences however it still sticks to the original Romeo and Juliet. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p class="Reflectionongrades">
            <h7><b> Reflection:</b></h7> <br><br>
                I think that I did prepare very welll for the test as I think that I got most questions correct and might have messed up some questions. I think I should have read <br>
                more adaptation texts and not watch more adaptations as I would have been more prepared when reading the adaptation because I did not scan the text and read it fully so <br>
                I wasted quite a bit of time to try and understand how it is an adaptation. That is why next time I think I should look and scan for key differences and similarties so I can <br>
                save time and have more time to check my work. <br><br>
                
                I think that I did good writing about the implicit adaptation and less about the explicit adaptation as in the explicit adaptation I could not really find too much differences <br>
                so that is why I feel more confident writing about the implicit adaptations as I could find more differences and changes allowing me to write more about how it impaceted the audience <br>
                and how it effected the plot line and genre. <br><br>

                I think that I could have learned more about how to analyze genres in particular and understand more about the genre as in the summative I talked less about the genre and more about the <br>
                setting and character. I think I also find it difficult to understand the genre escpecially when it is an explicit adaptation and not an implicit adaptation. <br>
                I think I did good enought for D but not that good for A. <br><br><br><br>

            <h7><b>Reflection after the grades:</b></h7> <br><br>
                Reflecting on my recent efforts in analyzing and comparing and contrasting various subjects, I can't help but acknowledge my shortcomings. It's clear to me that <br>
                I didn't perform as well as I had hoped in these areas. Despite my best intentions, I struggled to effectively compare and contrast the topics I was working on. <br>
                This has left me feeling somewhat disappointed and frustrated with my own performance. <br><br>

                One silver lining, however, is that I managed to write most of the words correctly. This demonstrates that I have a strong grasp of the language, which is an <br>
                essential foundation for effective communication and analysis. It's encouraging to know that my vocabulary and language skills are relatively sound, but that alone <br>
                is not enough to produce high-quality analysis and comparisons. <br><br>

                In light of my less-than-satisfactory performance, I've decided to take proactive steps to improve my analytical abilities. I'm determined to revise my textbook <br>
                and delve deeper into the subject matter, ensuring a better understanding of the topics at hand. This will include reviewing relevant literature and scholarly sources,<br>
                which will provide a solid foundation for more accurate and insightful analysis. <br><br>

                Furthermore, I've recognized that my grammar could use improvement, even if I can spell words correctly. Clear, concise, and grammatically sound writing is crucial <br>
                for effective communication and analysis. To address this, I plan to dedicate more time to studying grammar rules and practicing my writing skills. I will work on sentence <br>
                structure, punctuation, and overall writing fluency to make my analysis more coherent and engaging. I am going to watch videos and read books on how to write a proper PEEL <br>
                paragraph and where to put the quotations.   <br><br>

                While it's disheartening to realize that I didn't perform as well as I would have liked in my previous analysis and comparisons, this experience has become a valuable learning <br>
                opportunity. It has highlighted areas that need improvement and motivated me to take concrete steps to enhance my skills. With dedication and a commitment to growth, I am confident <br>
                that I can turn these setbacks into opportunities for personal and academic development. <br><br><br><br>
